description: "Triplanetary is a science fiction novel and space opera by American\
  \ writer E. E. Smith. It was first serialized in the magazine Amazing Stories in\
  \ 1934. After the original four novels of the Lensman series were published, Smith\
  \ expanded and reworked Triplanetary into the first of two prequels for the series.\
  \ The expanded Triplanetary was published in book form in 1948 by Fantasy Press.\
  \ The second prequel, First Lensman, was a new original novel published in 1950\
  \ by Fantasy Press.\nThe novel covers several episodes in an eons-long human breeding\
  \ project by the super-intelligences of the Arisians. This alien race is breeding\
  \ two genetic lines to become the ultimate weapon in Arisia's cosmic war with their\
  \ arch-enemies, the Eddorians. The initial chapters cover the Kinnison genetic line\
  \ during the fall of Atlantis and Nero's reign in Rome. These tales were inserted\
  \ into the novel following the serialized release, along with chapters covering\
  \ members of the Kinnison line in World Wars One, Two, and Three.\nThe final chapter\
  \ of Triplanetary tells of the discovery of the inertialess drive that allows faster-than-light\
  \ travel. Patrolman Conway Costigan and his friends engage in a space battle with\
  \ Gray Roger the pirate gangster. This conflict is complicated by the arrival of\
  \ the technologically superior, extra-Solar, amphibian-like Nevians, resulting in\
  \ the first interstellar war involving humans. In this story Virgil Samms and Roderick\
  \ Kinnison, important members of the two breeding lines, are introduced.\n From\
